# Instructions: 2 Functions #
## Function 1 (line 70): Calculate Dimensional Weights for each cart item. ##
You are **creating a shipping calculator** for an online store. **Resources:** Here is a [sheet with three Guinea Pig supply items](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/126gkcIq-qV_TUj57O4AE25ivtdfwt4FmEpMTfl7e44o/edit?gid=0#gid=0).  Get info on each item from [PetCo (price, weight, dimensions)](https://www.petco.com/shop/en/petcostore/). 
1. Dimensions could be litres, length width height, or something else.  **Your program needs to convert litres to cubic inches**.
1. Weight could be in ounces or pounds.  **Your program needs to convert ounces to pounds.**
1. Once you know cubic inches, get the "dimensional weight" for each by dividing by 139.  [Read about that here](https://redstagfulfillment.com/dimensional-weight-calculator/). Your shipping is based on whichever is greater - the dimensional weight or the actual weight in pounds.
