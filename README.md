# Instructions #
You are creating a shipping calculator for an online store. Here is a [sheet with three Guinea Pig supply items](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/126gkcIq-qV_TUj57O4AE25ivtdfwt4FmEpMTfl7e44o/edit?gid=0#gid=0).  Get info from [PetCo (for each item: price, weight, dimensions)](https://www.petco.com/shop/en/petcostore/). You will have to estimate dimensions - do your best!

Once you know weight (in pounds - there are 16 ounces in a pound) and dimensions (cubic inches - you may have to [convert from litres](https://www.unitconverters.net/volume/liters-to-cubic-inches.htm)) you can get the "dimensional weight" for each by dividing by 139.  [Read about that here](https://redstagfulfillment.com/dimensional-weight-calculator/).  Your shipping is based on whichever is greater - the dimensional weight or the actual weight.
